Adding items inside a list:

cars = ["bmw","audi","porsche"]
cars.insert(1,"bugatti")
print(cars)

Output:
['bmw', 'bugatti', 'audi', 'porsche']

here i'll explain the 4 th line of the code:
cars  - assigned variable for list
insert - this is function
(1,"bugatti") - 1 shows where we want place the string(bugatti), bugatti-this is  string
