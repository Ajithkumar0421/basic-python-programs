Add code to the following cell to swap variables a and b 
(so that a refers to the object previously referred to by b and vice versa).

a = [1, 2, 3]
b = [3, 2, 1]


answer:
The most straightforward solution is to use a third variable to temporarily store one of the old values. e.g.:

tmp = a
a = b
b = tmp
If you've read lots of Python code, you might have seen the following trick to swap two variables in one line:

a, b = b, a
