here i am assigning a two variables with some values to find area of circle, with this help of you can this methodoly,
you can use for diffrent structures,like square, rectangle,triangle, 
you can find area of those strucures

pi = 3.14159 # approximate
diameter = 3

# Create a variable called 'radius' equal to half the diameter
radius = diameter/2

# Create a variable called 'area', using the formula for the area of a circle: pi times the radius squared
area = pi*(radius**2)

print(area)

output:
7.068
